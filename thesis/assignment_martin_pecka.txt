Preliminary scope of work
=========================

The thesis will focus on methods of offline extraction of features from ionograms (recorded echoes from the Mars' ionosphere) captured by the MARSIS instrument onboard the Mars Express spacecraft. The extraction will include noise supression and algorithmic recognition of parametrically defined 2D features. This task differs from classical offline pattern recognition tasks in the fact that even the patterns to find are not precisely defined - instead, they are defined as parametrized curves and shapes. The student will try to adjust common pattern recognition techniques for this slightly different task or develop some problem-specific approaches. Then these methods will be applied to real data, and the results will be compared to manual (human-aided) feature extraction. Finally, the student will provide a summary of his findings and experiences.

Guidelines
==========

1) Inspect the data format and properties of the MARSIS instrument
2) Learn about pattern recognition techniques
3) Select appropriate pattern recognition methods (or develop some problem specific ones)
4) Apply the methods to real data
5) Compare the methods one to each other and also against the manually-extracted data
6) Discuss the obtained results
