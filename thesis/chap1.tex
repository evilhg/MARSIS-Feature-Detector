\chapter{Mars Express, MARSIS and ionograms}

\section{Mars Express}
First of all, let us briefly introduce the spacecraft carrying all the equipment needed to acquire ionograms. Its name is \textit{Mars~Express} (MEX) and it was launched by the \textit{European Space Agency} (ESA) on 2~June~2003.

MEX arrived to Mars at its orbit with periapsis 250~km and apoapsis over 11000~km on~25~December~2003~\citep{Chicarro2004} with seven~onboard scientific instruments and a~landing module called Beagle~2. We're going to take a look at all of them in the following subsections; just Beagle~2 description is going to be rather short, because the landing sequence failed (for an unknown reason) and the lander didn't establish connection after it landed (if it landed at all)\citep[p.~4]{Chicarro2004}. 

The mission of MEX has several goals like ``global studies of the surface, subsurface and atmosphere at unprecedented spatial and spectral resolutions'' \citep[p.~viii]{Chicarro2004}. One of the goals, however, stands out among all the others. It is the search for water (or its traces) on Mars' surface or subsurface.

Why water? There is lots of geological evidence of former water occurrence. But before the~MEX~mission nobody had proved or refuted presence of water on~Mars in the present. Knowing more about water on Mars and its history, the scientists could postulate better hypotheses about the possibility of (former) life on the~planet \citep[p.~ix]{Chicarro2004}. \pdfcomment{Tady si nejsem uplne jisty tim, jak uvadet citace, protoze prakticky cela podkapitola cerpa z jedine knizky}

The original mission lifetime of MEX was projected up~to the~end of~2005 (which would be 1~Martian~year = 687~Earth~days) \citep{ESA2004}. However, overcoming some small problems (as the Solid State Mass Memory anomalies described in~\citep{ESA2011} or the~MARSIS~antennas deployment problems in~2004~\citep{ESA2004a,ESA2005}), MEX has worked on its science goals up to this day and its science mission was extended until~2014~\citep{ESA2013} (after 3~preceding similar extensions). Fred Jansen, MEX mission manager, said MEX had enough fuel for another 14~years of~operation (at the~beginning of~2012)~\citep{Clark2012}. So there is a hopeful prospect of further and even deeper Mars exploration (eg. \citep{Gurnett2005}~discovered an~unexpected way of~using the MARSIS~instrument so that they ``added magnetometer functionality'' to~MARSIS).

In the~next subsections you can find~out more about particular MEX instruments. The descriptions are based on~\citep{Chicarro2004} which you can see for~more detailed information.

\subsection{HRSC (\textit{High--Resolution Stereo Camera})}

HRSC is a~high--resolution pushbroom\footnote{A camera that scans the image by rows perpendicular to the flight direction. See \url{http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EO1/eo1\_2.php} for more details.} camera for~surface imaging. Its goals are to~characterize surface structure and morphology at~resolution 10~m~px$^{-1}$ (regions of interest at 2~m~px$^{-1}$), surface topology at high vertical resolution, atmospheric phenomena, physical properties of the~surface and to~classify terrain and to~refine the~martian cartographic base. It is also intended to observe Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos during their approaches.

HRSC is~able to capture the surface at~resolution up~to~10~m~px$^{-1}$ with field of~view~11.9°, covering a 52.2~km wide strip of surface at~height 250~km (which is the~periapsis of~MEX). The camera consists~of 9~CCD~sensors allowing it to acquire triple stereo images in 4~colors and 5~phase angles. What is a very useful property of these images, is that they are taken nearly simultaneously and thus having the same illumination and other observational conditions (which further helps in photogrammetric processing of the images).  

HRSC also contains a~super--high--resolution camera called~SRC (\textit{Super--Resolution Channel}) aimed at~targeted observations of~particular surface details. With image resolution 2.3~m~px$^{-1}$ and field of view 0.54° it provides a detailed view of a 2.3x2.35~km large surface. Its main purpose is to~take details of~places of~interest, eg. future landing sites for other landing modules.

% achievements
Up to November~2011 HRSC had covered about~88\% of the martian surface \citep[pp.~72--73]{ESA2011a} and still continues to gather new data. The scientific results of HRSC are for example better exploration of fluviatile valleys \citep{Mangold2008}, dicovery of numerous glacial landforms, investigating lava flows, dicovery of ``dust devils'' (fast moving dust storms) or providing data to derive a detailed topographic model of more than 20\% of Phobos \citep[pp.~945--949]{Jaumann2007}.

\subsection{OMEGA (\textit{Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité})}
OMEGA is a medium-- and high--resolution spectrometer operating in~visible and near--IR spectra (0.38--5.1 $\upmu$m wavelength). Its medium--resolution operating mode (from heights of~1500 to~4000~km) can measure with the resolution~2--5~km targeting at global surface coverage, while the high--resolution~mode (from the~close vicinity of~periapsis) brings resolution 350~m or~better, but will cover only a small fraction of the surface. 

As stated in~\citep[pp.~38--39]{Chicarro2004}, the main goals are to~study the~evolution of~Mars, to~detect minerals hidden to~lower resolutions, to~map mineralogical boundaries between geological units, to~reveal gradients in hydration minerals related to~fossil water flows and to~monitor features associated with~wind transportation. In~particular, it is intended to find carbonates (not found on martian surface until the launch of MEX) and water ice. It is also able to measure atmospheric pressure, CO and H$_2$O column densities and surface temperature.

Recent contributions of the OMEGA payload are e.g. confirmation of liquid water on the surface when the planet was young \citep{Loizeau2012}, discovery of infrared and ultraviolet glows in the atmosphere \citep{Bertaux2012}, proving that Mars had a hot and wet period \citep{Chevrier2007}, analyzing the south polar cap and finding out it is formed mainly of water ice \citep{Doute2007}, observation of CO$_2$ ice clouds \citep{Montmessin2007} or finding ferric oxides near the equator \citep{Masse2008}.
